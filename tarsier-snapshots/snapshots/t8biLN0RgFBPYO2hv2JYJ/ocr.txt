                                                    [ 35 ] For our clients, tax issues are incredibly important, but can also be quite daunting. I spend much of my day immersed in the
                                                    highly technical and complex world of tax law, but our clients are rightfully focused on growing their business or successfully
                                                    completing a transaction. What I enjoy most is bridging that gap - explaining and breaking down the most difficult tax issues facing
                                                    our clients into clear, digestible guidance. By promoting our clients' understanding about tax issues, they feel confident in their
                                                    decisions and that they have achieved the best possible outcome.
