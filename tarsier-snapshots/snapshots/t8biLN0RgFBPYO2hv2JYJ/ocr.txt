    [ 32 ] Get to Know Billy                       [ 33 ]                        What do you enjoy most about your job?

                                                   [ 34 ] For our clients, tax issues are incredibly important, but can also be quite daunting. I spend much of my day
                                                  immersed in the highly technical and complex world of tax law, but our clients are rightfully focused on growing their
                                                  business or successfully completing a transaction. What I enjoy most is bridging that gap - explaining and breaking
                                                  down the most difficult tax issues facing our clients into clear, digestible guidance. By promoting our clients'
                                                  understanding about tax issues, they feel confident in their decisions and that they have achieved the best possible
                                                  outcome.
