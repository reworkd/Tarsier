   GREETINGS FROM                [ 58 ] 1366 motherboards aren't cheap in the' used' market. And certainly you'd be able to

                                 [ 178 ] The 950 BLCK goes way higher than any the new ones ( my 950 operated near 190 ) and
                                overclocked it comes pretty close to my LGA2011, LGA1150 and LGA1155 CPUs. With that said,

                                 [ 200 ] Same with my L5640. Even though the multipliers suck and only does 18x. Had it run at
                                212BCLK but that required so much voltage, I'd settle for 3.6GHz. Used a 990X purely on GHz
                                basis for comparison.
