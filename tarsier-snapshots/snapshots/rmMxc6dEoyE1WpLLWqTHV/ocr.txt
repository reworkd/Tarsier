                                    [52] According to the chart, you'd be better off with a new Core i5 on the 1150 platform.
                                    [53] 1366 motherboards aren't cheap in the 'used' market. And certainly you'd be able to
                                    achieve at least [56] some [54] recovery for on the i7 CPU by selling it. So I personally feel
                                    you'd be better off pursuing a new platform based on a cheaper modern motherboard. Energy
                                    consumption should be less as well, and you'd get benefits like SATA-3 support, PCI-E 3.0

                                    [74] Then you may as well throw it back together and run it for a while. Its not dramatically
                                    slower for most desktop or gaming purposes than the modern stuff. Get yourself a nice SSD
                                    and you should be good for a few more years unless you're a serious video editor or high-end
                                    gamer. In which case, you probably should be comparing against a modern i7 instead.

    [@84] crowTrobot                [91] I'd keep the i7-950 for now. Not worth it, especially considering Haswell retail overclocks
    [85] Deal Addict                like garbage. The upside of going with 1150 is that it uses a lot less power, has integrated
                                    graphics so you can still use it just in case your video card dies, new CPUs support newer
                                    instructions sets for some programs that can utilize it, native USB3 and SATA6, and PCI-E 3.0.
                                    [92] Most likely your X58 motherboard has USB3 and SATA6 functionality already anyway via
                                    3rd party (not really any worse than native Intel, as it can be controller dependent specially
                                    with USB 3) and PCI-E 3.0 advantage is marketing gimmick right now when it comes to the
      [87] Jan 21, 2010             crop of current video cards as the lanes are not exactly bottlenecked.

                                    [158] Thats from a S775 Q6600 to a 4770k, I would have kept my i7-920/X58 Sabretooth rig
                                    for a few more years easily, if I hadn't come across an insane deal on a xeon 8C/16T monster

    [@165] Dinujan                  [172] I haven't seen any notable differences from when I upgraded from my 950/ASUS
    [166] Deal Fanatic              EXTREME II to my 3570k/ASUS Maximus V.

                                    [173] The 950 BLCK goes way higher than any the new ones(my 950 operated near 190) and
                                    overclocked it comes pretty close to my LGA2011, LGA1150 and LGA1155 CPUs. With that said,

                                    [195] Same with my L5640. Even though the multipliers suck and only does 18x. Had it run at
                                    212BCLK but that required so much voltage, I'd settle for 3.6GHz. Used a 990X purely on GHz
                                    basis for comparison.

                                    [196] Would be nice to get but it's not worth the 800 difference.
