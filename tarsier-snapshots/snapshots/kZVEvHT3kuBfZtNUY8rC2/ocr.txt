                                    [ @ 16 ] https://saastrappers.com/interviews/ivan-kutskir-photopea/

                                    [ 17 ] Question: Can you give us some information about your background?
                                     [ 18 ] Answer: I was born in Ukraine and moved to Czechia with my
                                    parents when I was 11. When I turned 18, I came to Prague to study at the
                                    university.

                                     [ 19 ] Question: What did you study in the university?
                                    [ 20 ] Answer: My major was in computer science.

                                    [ 21 ] Question: And at that time, I guess you were busy with flash games
                                    and other stuff, right?
                                    [ 22 ] Answer: Yes, that's correct. I actually started making flash games
                                    even before going to university. I began playing with flash around when I
                                    was 15.

                                    [ 23 ] Question: Is it something related to your family, or was it your
                                    interest?
                                    [ 24 ] Answer: It was more of a personal interest. My two cousins, who are
                                    three years older than me, had a computer. I got really excited about it,
                                    which led me to want my own computer. I got my first computer around
                                    2013 or 14. When I got it, I immediately started learning things like how to
                                    make websites. It was the beginning of the internet era here in Czechia,
                                    and we had limited internet access initially.

                                     [ 25 ] Question: You were coding and developing flash games, and you
                                    started to earn money from those games, right?
                                     [ 26 ] Answer: Yes, that's right. When I was in high school, around 15 or 16
                                    years old, I began connecting with people who needed Flash games or
                                    animations. I started making some money before university by doing these
                                    freelance projects.

                                    [ 27 ] Question: What led you to focus on Photopea after flash games?
                                    [ 28 ] Answer: Well, during my high school years, Flash was owned by
                                    Macromedia, later bought by Adobe. I used Adobe Photoshop back then
                                    and was quite proficient with it. While I continued making some flash
                                    games for money during my first years at the university, my main focus
                                    was on my studies. However, I got really excited about the web
                                    technologies emerging around then, like the Google Chrome browser, web
                                    games without Flash, web GL, and other new web technologies. I saw that
                                    web - based applications could be much more performant than they were
                                    five years ago with Internet Explorer. So, I transitioned from making Flash
                                    games to developing JavaScript games and monetized them with ads.

                                    [ 29 ] Question: You found the missing feature of Adobe and decided to
                                    create your own Photoshop service, right?
                                     [ 30 ] Answer: Yes, exactly. As I was working on these games and other
                                    projects, I came up with the idea to make a web - based viewer for PSD
                                    files. I wasn't aiming to create an editor at first; I just wanted a platform
                                    where one could open a PSD file, and the JavaScript would process and
                                    analyze the file to provide a preview of its content, like showing how many
                                    layers are there.

                                    [ 31 ] Question: Adobe didn't offer any features like this at the time, right?
                                    [ 32 ] Answer: Correct. Back then, if you wanted to open a PSD file, you
                                    had to buy Photoshop. There was no other way. You could open PSD files
                                    in GIMP, but it would open them without any styles or adjustment layers,
                                    so it wasn't accurate.

                                    [ 33 ] Question: Do you have any advice for bootstrappers?
                                     [ 34 ] Answer: One crucial piece of advice is to genuinely enjoy what you
                                    are doing. Your project should be something you're passionate about,
                                    almost like a hobby. If you're excited about your work, it will feel less like a
                                    task and more like something you're eager to spend time on. For me,
                                    working on Photopea was akin to playing an instrument; it was something
                                    I did for enjoyment, not just as a job.

                                     [ 35 ] When starting out, don't be intimidated by the idea of entering a
                                    crowded market or tackling complex tasks. Begin by focusing on the core,
                                    essential features of your product, the ones that are most important and
                                    useful. These don't have to be numerous or complicated; even a simplified
                                    version of an existing product can be valuable if it addresses specific
                                    needs effectively. For example, I focused on essential features in
                                    Photopea that were either poorly implemented or missing in other
                                    software.

                                    [ 36 ] It's also important to recognize that you don't need to have everything
                                    figured out from the start. You can develop your product gradually. Start
                                    with the most important features and build from there. This approach
                                    reduces the risk of feeling overwhelmed and allows you to adapt and
                                    respond to user feedback.
