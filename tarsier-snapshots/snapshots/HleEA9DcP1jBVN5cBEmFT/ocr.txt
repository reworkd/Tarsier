**[ 82 ] Glossary of Terms**
       [ @ 83 ] Home  [ @ 84 ] Legislation [ @ 85 ] Glossary of Terms

  [ 86 ] Within Occupational Safety and Health worldwide there is a huge amount of terms and definitions that are used and not all are standard in different locations or even in
      different companies within the same location. As an example the definition of a Lost Time Injury ( LTI ) is different across the world and in Abu Dhabi evidence has
      shown different terms being used in neighboring companies.
  [ 87 ] The OSHAD - SF - Glossary of terms is a mandatory document and entities must ensure that they consider this during the development of their systems.
