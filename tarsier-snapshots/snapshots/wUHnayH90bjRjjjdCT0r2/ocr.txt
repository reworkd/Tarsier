                practices. (If you are pregnant, or think you may be pregnant, please contact your women's care provider.)

                trusted companion to any of your visits. Also, be sure to let us know if you receive care outside the ECU Health system so we can have a complete record. For
                each visit, bring your insurance card, photo identification and all medications including over-the-counter, vitamins and supplements.
