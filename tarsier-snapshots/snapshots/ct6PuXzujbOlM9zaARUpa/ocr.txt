                                    [229] It does look like a good time. Hopefully there is enough variety to keep the game
                                    going. Those melee moves are brutal

                                    [230] I must have watched Robocop more than a dozen times when I was a kid. One of

                                    [359] We need more games like this.
                                    [360] Not blockbuster AAA titles, but just rock-solid games with modest budgets.
                                    One-and-done games, not huge franchises with over a dozen installments. Games that
                                    look pretty good but not amazing".
                                    [361] Games like Robocop, Shadow Warrior, Hard Reset, Evil West, Terminator
                                    Resistance, and so on.
                                    [362] I would love to see AAA Publishers set up satellite studios with finite budgets and
                                    make them do side projects" like this. Small teams, modest budgets, no plans to milk
                                    the franchise...just making good games for the sake of making a good game. Of course
                                    I'd prefer it remain indie/small-scale as well but whatever.

                                    [450] I was already pretty sure this was going to be a cool game. Gameplay looked fine
                                    and the developer has a good track record.

                                    [477] Cryostasis, Metro, Stalker 2, ... the list of games made in eastern europe that
                                    somehow look better than western games is long and vast.

                                    [496] The 2 biggest problems the game has is 1) its first person, you can't see the
                                    character except for cutscenes. He's an iconic character and yet you just see his gun. 2)
                                    he's a bullet sponge, as you see in the first gameplay scenes, all those bullets flying and
                                    he takes hardly and damage, and then he walks on top of a grenade and nothing
                                    happens to him.

                                    [515] Sadly the performance is dogshit and the pop-in for textures is ridiculous. Tried it
                                    on my PC and it was lackluster.

                                    [801] Just saying what I see. Of course he's slow, but the game doesn't have to be. It
                                    also looks simple. Might become deeper later on, but I dunno. It did not look deep, lol. It
                                    also looks easy, which makes it look more boring than it have to. Hope there are higher
                                    difficulties than whatever that was in the video.
                                    [802] The video you posted also shows short levels and long cutscenes. Not the best
                                    recipe for greatness..
                                    [803] If the game is short, arcadey fun for a not too high of a price, could be an OK
                                    game I guess. I like that you got a rank at the end, which implies that you're supposed to
                                    replay levels and beat your score, which I generally enjoy doing in arcade games.
