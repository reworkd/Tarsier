                              [ 43 ] 2 ) How do you think being Unclassified for 1 term ( Jan 2012 ) - completing 12 prerequisite credits would look ... if I am planning on being accepted to a degree in
                                  May 2012?

                              [ 44 ] Just put those credits towards my new degree?
                              [ 45 ] Do you think this would hurt me ...
                              [ 46 ] Anyone accepted been in a similar situation?

                              [ 47 ] Thanks so much [ @ 48 ]

                              [ 49 ] from ubc website:
                              [ 50 ]" Generally, we do not recommend repeating courses to improve your overall GPA. Students who enroll in unclassified, non - degree programs for the sole
                                  purpose of improving their academic qualifications are advised that only a small proportion of such candidates gain admission."

                              [ 59 ] I don't think that completing prerequisite courses as unclassified would necessarily make your application look bad. In that scenario you are at least studying a
                                  coherent line of school work. That part of the FAQ refers to individuals who primarily take" bird" courses to increase their GPA.

                              [ 60 ] That being said, it's always good to email adcom and see what they think.

                              [ 61 ] Good luck.

                              [ 68 ] Hi there;
                **A**
                              [ 69 ] In first year I did 8 courses, In second year I did 9 during the academic year ( and 1 during the summer ), and I did 9 in third year ( and 2 during the summer ).

                              [ 70 ] I had a reduced course load because I was dealing with serious family issues and then grieving the death of an immediate family member that I was very close
                                  to. Along with the grief I had symptoms of depression ( and this is well documented ).

                              [ 71 ] However, I did manage to maintain a 95 % average / 3.99 GPA while taking rigorous courses.

                              [ 72 ] Do you think I need to demonstrate 10 courses an academic year before applying to UBC?

                              [ 73 ] I have a three - year BSc degree, and I am considering taking this next year away from university to gain extra - curricular experience and hopefully earn some
                                  money, but I am concerned that applying to UBC with no full - time years on my transcript may be hopeless.


                              [ 74 ] Thanks for your input.

                              [ 83 ] Are you IP? Yes, you should definitely give it a shot, don't worry too much about the full time thing. A person who averages 95 % in 8 and 9 courses isn't going to
                                  drop to a 60 % by taking 1 more course

                              [ 90 ] I think you should contact UBC about whether or not they care about taking 24 or 27 credits rather than 30. I took 25 credits in 2nd year and ended up fine. A
                                  95 % average is pretty ridiculous even for OOP let alone IP, so I think you should definitely apply.

                              [ 99 ] I guess my concerns about the reduced course load mostly stems from the fact that some of the other Canadian medical schools list a full - course load for at
                                  least one year as an absolute requirement, so I thought perhaps very few students with a reduced course load make into UBC even though they state on their
                                  admission site that it is not technically necessary.

                                   [ 100 ] Anyways, I will take the advice of emailing UBC, and will later post their reply in here in case it is helpful for other students with similar concerns.

                                   [ 101 ] Thanks again.
