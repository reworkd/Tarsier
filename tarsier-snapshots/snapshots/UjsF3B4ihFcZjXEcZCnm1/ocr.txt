                                          Rebecca James [40] have you looked into alternative funding, such as crowdsourcing? Kickstarter or
                                        indiegogo may be good places to start.

                                        [55] We got an experience. We took an idea of customer to start his dropshiping e-commerce 2018 and brand.
                                        [56] In two weeks we made a identity and project visual concept. He went to the bank and took a credit
                                        in several dozens of euro. In a few months project successfully launched and working till this days.
                                        [57] Thats a great example with own pluses and minuses but it works.

                                        [171] There are many platforms from where you get funding. If you have a good business idea that can
                                        flourish then you can take help from funders such as kickstarter, etc. Or you can make a business partner
                                        who can invest in your business and take some of the shares. It can also help in contribution of the
                                        future products and ideas that can grow your business.

                                        [193] Hi,
                                        [194] Never forget, if you are in the US, the SBIR program with grants of over 1 million for innovative
                                        startups. I've been an evaluator for years of such programs and it's the best seed capital any company
                                        can get to scale up and overcome the chasm".
                                        [195] If you are interested, please let me know. I have further material and there is also a grant in some
                                        states to cover the consulting costs to prepare the application!
                                        [196] Best,
                                        [197] Antonio
