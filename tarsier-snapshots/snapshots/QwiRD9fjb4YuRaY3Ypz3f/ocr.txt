                  create duplicates, or if my catalog will recognize the image files and reconnect to my catalog ......

             [ 141 ] It looks like [ 143 ] Find > All Missing Files [ 142 ] ] was added in version 12. So, I don't think there is an easy way
             to find missing files in version 7 other than by manually looking for a question mark icon.
