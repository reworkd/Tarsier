                   [ 65 ] so, i lost half my photos due to a HD failure ( the last backup was a long time ago ) however, i do have all
                  my original SD cards and I'm thinking i      can at least get my originals back. not sure if this will
                  create duplicates, or if my catalog will recognize the image files and reconnect to my catalog .....

             [ 113 ] Select [ 116 ] Find > All Missing Files [ 114 ] from the menu and all of the missing files will be displayed in the

             [ 153 ] It looks like [ 155 ] Find > All Missing Files [ 154 ] was added in version 12. So, I don't think there is an easy way
             to find missing files in version 7 other than by manually looking for a question mark icon.
