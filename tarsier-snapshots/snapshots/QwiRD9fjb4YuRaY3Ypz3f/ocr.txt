                                [59] so, i lost half my photos due to a HD failure ( the last backup was a long time ago)
                                however, i do have all my original SD cards and I'm thinking i can at least get my originals
                                back. not sure if this will create duplicates, or if my catalog will recognize the image files and
                                reconnect to my catalog.....

                      [72] Are you still able to access your Elements 7 catalog. If so, I assume that the photos lost on your
                      hard drive appear as missing. In that case, you should copy the SD card originals to your
                      replacement drive.
                      [73] In the ideal case, you can replicate the path of the original photos to the new drive, including
                      the same drive letter and folder structure. Hopefully, that will solve the problem. Otherwise, you will
                      need to link the missing files to the new location.
                      [74] Try a test with one card and see what happens.

                                [88] Thanks! I got all my original files back from my SD cards. I did however lose some of my
                                edited files. I now need to delete all the unfound/edited thumb nails from my catalog. I cant
                                figure out how to do that? i somehow also created a bunch of duplicate thumb nails that are
                                     not found".

                      [104] Select [107] Find All Missing Files [105] from the menu and all of the missing files will be
                      displayed in the grid. Select the thumbnails (press [108] Ctrl+A [106] to select all of them) and
                      delete them.
                      [109] Now, do I really have to tell you that it is time to backup your catalog and photos or will that be
                      rubbing salt into the wound?

                      [141] It looks like [143] Find All Missing Files [142] was added in version 12. So, I don't think there is
                      an easy way to find missing files in version 7 other than by manually looking for a question mark
                      icon.
