                   [ 67 ] so, i lost half my photos due to a HD failure ( the last backup was a long time ago )
                  however, i do have all my original SD cards and I'm thinking i can at least get my originals
                  back. not sure if this will create duplicates, or if my catalog will recognize the image files and
                  reconnect to my catalog .....

             [ 83 ] Are you still able to access your Elements 7 catalog. If so, I assume that the photos lost on your
             hard drive appear as missing. In that case, you should copy the SD card originals to your
             replacement drive.
             [ 84 ] In the ideal case, you can replicate the path of the original photos to the new drive, including
             the same drive letter and folder structure. Hopefully, that will solve the problem. Otherwise, you will
             need to link the missing files to the new location.

                  figure out how to do that ?? i somehow also created a bunch of duplicate thumb nails that are

             [ 117 ] Select [ 120 ] Find > All Missing Files [ 118 ] ] from the menu and all of the missing files will be

             rubbing salt into the wound? [ 123 ]

             [ 157 ] It looks like [ 159 ] Find > All Missing Files [ 158 ] was added in version 12. So, I don't think there
             is an easy way to find missing files in version 7 other than by manually looking for a question mark
             icon.
