                                             about the self - attention mechanism inherently effective at expressing semantic composition?

                                             action modalities influence semantic representations?
                                             [ 222 ] What is the underlying relationship between [ 225 ] symbolic and statistical [ 226 ] approaches [ 223 ] ]? Why do some parts of

                                             symbols a formalism that humans apply to our environment?
                                             [ 228 ] And a few miscellaneous ones: What makes specifically human brains so good at manipulating symbols, genetically, structurally,
                                            and culturally? How does the brain represent non - linguistic thoughts and is all perception [ @ 232 ] symbolic at some level [ 229 ]? How can
                                            classical theories from linguistics and [ @ 233 ] philosophy of language [ 230 ] aid modern research in NLP? Is internality an inherent
                                             [ @ 234 ] property of matter [ 231 ]?
