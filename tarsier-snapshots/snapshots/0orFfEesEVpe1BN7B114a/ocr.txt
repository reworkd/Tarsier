                                        V [ 97 ] This is a fascinating experiment! Interestingly this is also true of humans. We also recall best ( and
                                             therefore can act on ) information at the end and the beginning of a text passage. My take on this is that
                                             it may be a feature of the training data where it is simulating how people are writing ( i.e. processing )
                                             based on text that came before.
                                              [ 98 ] Also if you think how you yourself would give or receive instructions best. You and your name
                                             would be the most impactful. Granted here there may be some underlying schemas about the name
                                             that are not part of the training, but regardless this also aligns with human tendencies.
                                              [ 99 ] EDIT: Now after looking deeper into the article, it seems that position 3/5 was still more impactful
                                             than the beginning. This does not fit as well to the picture, but I see I may have thought about this
                                             wrong. The experiment doesn't measure just simple recall, where recency and primacy effects should
                                             dominate, but also has a component of solving contradiction. In many cases the last" revision" could be
                                             the correct one in texts. But this is now pure speculation. Very interesting.
