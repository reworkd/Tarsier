                   [38] As a user, I may not want to be tied down to OpenAI. There are a lot of companies offering APIs for LLMs. We should
                   explore what are the best, and provide an interface to select between them

                   [49] I did some initial analysis and it appears that AutoGPT uses Langchain in chain.ts [50] to communicate with OpenAI.
                   Since Langchain appears to offer support for other LLMs (see e.g.                                                                                          [86] Development
                   https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/llms [51] ) then a possible solution might be to parameterize                                 [87] No branches or pull requests
                   the LLM(s) in chain.ts. Specific settings would have to be provided for supported LLM(s).
