                      [ 40 ] As a user, I may not want to be tied down to OpenAl. There are a lot of companies offering APIs for LLMs. We should
                     explore what are the best, and provide an interface to select between them

                      [ @ 52 ] @ asim - shrestha [ 51 ] ] great idea                                                      [ 89 ] Milestone
                      [ 53 ] I did some initial analysis and it appears that AutoGPT uses Langchain in [ @ 56 ] chain.ts [ 54 ] to communicate with [ 88 ] No milestone
                     OpenAl. Since Langchain appears to offer support for other LLMs ( see e.g.
                      [ @ 57 ] https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/llms [ 55 ] ) then a possible solution might be to [ 90 ] Development
                     parameterize the LLM ( s ) in chain.ts. Specific settings would have to be provided for supported LLM ( s ).
