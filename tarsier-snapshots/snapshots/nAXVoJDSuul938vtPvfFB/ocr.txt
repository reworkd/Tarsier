                      [ 39 ] As a user, I may not want to be tied down to OpenAI. There are a lot of companies offering APIs for LLMs. We should
                     explore what are the best, and provide an interface to select between them

                     [ @ 49 ] @ asim - shrestha [ 48 ] ] great idea de                                                    [ 86 ] Milestone
                      [ 50 ] I did some initial analysis and it appears that AutoGPT uses Langchain in [ @ 53 ] chain.ts [ 51 ] ] to communicate with [ 85 ] ] No milestone
                     OpenAl. Since Langchain appears to offer support for other LLMs ( see e.g.
                      [ @ 54 ] https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/llms [ 52 ] ) then a possible solution might be to [ 87 ] Development
                     parameterize the LLM ( s ) in chain.ts. Specific settings would have to be provided for supported LLM ( s ).
                                                                                                                         [ 88 ] No branches or pull requests
