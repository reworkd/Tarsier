              [ 48 ] As a user, I may not want to be tied down to OpenAl. There are a lot of companies offering APIs for LLMs. We should
             explore what are the best, and provide an interface to select between them

              [ @ 61 ] @ asim - shrestha [ 60 ] great idea d                                                                  [ 98 ] Milestone
              [ 62 ] I did some initial analysis and it appears that AutoGPT uses Langchain in [ @ 65 ] chain.ts [ 63 ] ] to communicate with [ 97 ] No milestone
             OpenAl. Since Langchain appears to offer support for other LLMS ( see e.g.
              [ @ 66 ] https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/tree/master/langchain/llms [ 64 ] ) then a possible solution might be to [ 99 ] Development
             parameterize the LLM ( s ) in chain.ts. Specific settings would have to be provided for supported LLM ( s ).     [ 100 ] No branches or pull requests
