                                               etc. ?? It would be a shame not to enjoy some of the nicer
                                               experiences while here - but if its not that important to you
                                               minimize time in wine country and just take a tour such as Platypus
                                               ( they will go to nice wineries but you can fine tune it to enjoy the
                                               best of the best if you so wish ).

                                               inside the park. For the rest there is some real good advise you

                                               the safari might be a good option for us. I went to the zoo last time
                                               I was here and I want to drag my wife there this time as she
                                               missed out. It's probably one of the best zoos I've been to so I
                                               might do the zoo / safari park in one day.
                                               [ 235 ] I will update the itinerary in a few days, just waiting to see if
