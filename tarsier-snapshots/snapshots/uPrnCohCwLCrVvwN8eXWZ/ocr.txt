                             [159] Fremont, California  [170] is before Santa Barbara [171] - do you still plan to back track?

                                                        debating, see the tidal pools at MacKerricher and decide if you

                                                        For a good tour company consider Platypus.

                                                        things to do there as well as the alternative of doing historic gold
                                                        rush trip highway 49. You also mentioned that you might want to
                                                        do Lake Tahoe [193] but this time it seemed too far east to you. you
                                                        could substitute Yosemite [194] perhaps - and then drive from
                                                        Yosemite to Oakhurst to Sequoia National Park.
                                                        [199] it seems that you are fine with the switchbacks driving to
                                                        sequoia from three rivers several times and wasting time doing so
                                                        on multiple days. Are you planning to also see Kings Canyon if
                                                        open? your choice - your vacation but most would say stay in the

                                                        if star gazing and going to Pioneer town appealed to you or not? If
                                                        not, then two nights in Palm Springs [202]. as mentioned there is
                                                        more to see in Palm Springs area than in north side of the park. Its
                                                        your choice.
                                                        [205] since you don't want the scenic route (Palm to Pines) to San
                                                        Diego [206] than take I-10 to I-15 to San Diego.
                                                        [208] I assume you are NOT interested in San Diego Safari Park
                                                        [209]. Since this is your 2nd time in San Diego and realize your

                                                        [211] what style wineries does Australia have - beautiful
                                                        architecture? modern art museums like the ones in Napa has?
                                                        Cave waterfalls inside a large winery? wine and food pairings,
                                                        etc.? It would be a shame not to enjoy some of the nicer
                                                        experiences while here - but if its not that important to you
                                                        minimize time in wine country and just take a tour such as Platypus
                                                        (they will go to nice wineries but you can fine tune it to enjoy the
                                                        best of the best if you so wish).

                                                        [256] Since you spent time in Carmel last time, I might suggest
                                                        making the Carmel stopover 1 night and Santa Cruz 2 nights. You
                                                        can easily catch up on your Carmel sightseeing in the afternoon of
                                                        arrival and the morning of the following day, then head to Santa
                                                        Cruz. In your full day there, you could explore Henry Cowell
                                                        Redwood Park as well as the Boardwalk and other in-town sights.
                                                        [257] I'd also suggest taking that night from Sacramento [258] and
                                                        moving it to Healdsburg [259] as the Sonoma [260] Valley is equally
                                                        (if not more) deserving of attention than the Napa Valley [261]. If
                                                        both you and the wife take turns tasting (and spitting) and driving,
                                                        you should be fine for 2 (or maybe 3) winery visits. And Sonoma
                                                        not only has different styles of wines than Napa (more dry whites),
                                                        it's more laid-back than the Napa Valley.
                                                        [266] Be sure to read Disneyland [267] tips and tricks on the
