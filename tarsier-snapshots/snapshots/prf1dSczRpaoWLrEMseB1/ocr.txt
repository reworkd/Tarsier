                                             [130] NOTICE OF DESTRUCTION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION RECORDS
                                             [131] Special Education records which have been collected by Douglas County School District related to the identification, evaluation, educational placement, or the provision of
                                             special education in the district, must be maintained under state and federal laws for the period of five (5) years after special education services have ended for the student.
                                             Special education services end when the student is no longer eligible for services, graduates, or completes his/her educational program at age 21, or moves from the district. This
                                             notification is to inform parents/guardians and former students of Douglas County School District's intent to destroy the special education records of students who exited special
                                             education services as of June 30, 2016. These records will be destroyed in accordance with state law unless the parent/guardian or eligible (adult) student notifies the school
                                             district otherwise. After five years, the records are no longer useful to the district, but may be useful to the parent/guardian or former student in applying for social security
                                             benefits, rehabilitation services, college entrance, etc. The parent/guardian or eligible (adult) student may request a copy of the records by requesting the records at this link (
