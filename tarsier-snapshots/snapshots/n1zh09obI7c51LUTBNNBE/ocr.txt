                                                       [ 27 ] The school offers a general program leading to a bachelor of science ( BSc ) or bachelor of arts ( BA ) degree. This undergraduate
                                                       degree is appropriate for many interdisciplinary areas. Visit [ @ 29 ] www.cs.sfu.ca [ 28 ] for information.

                                                       [ 30 ] Admission Requirements
                                                       [ 31 ] Entry into computing science programs is possible via
                                                         [ 32 ] direct admission from high school

                                                       [ 35 ] Admission is competitive. A separate admission average for each entry route is established each term, depending on spaces
                                                       available and subject to the approval of the Dean of Applied Sciences. Admission averages are calculated over a set of courses
                                                       satisfying particular breadth constraints.

                                                       [ 42 ] Internal Transfer
                                                       [ 43 ] Internal transfer allows students to transfer, within Simon Fraser University, from one faculty to another.
                                                       [ 44 ] Simon Fraser University students applying for School of Computing Science admission are selected on the basis of an
                                                       admission Computing Related Grade Point Average ( CRGPA ) and Cumulative Grade Point Average ( CGPA ). The CRGPA is
                                                       computed from all courses the student has taken from the following: ( CMPT 120, 128 or 130 ), ( CMPT 125, 129 or 135 ), CMPT 225,
                                                       ( CMPT 275 or 276 ), CMPT 295, CMPT 300, CMPT 307, MACM 101, ( CMPT 210 or MACM 201 ), MACM 316. Applicants must have
                                                       completed at least one MACM course and at least two CMPT courses from this list before applying. At least two courses used in the
                                                       CRGPA calculation must have been taken at SFU.
                                                       [ 45 ] No course may be included in the average if it is a duplicate of any previous course completed at Simon Fraser University or
                                                       elsewhere.
                                                       [ 46 ] The average for admission based on internal transfer is competitive and the school sets competitive averages each term.
                                                       [ 47 ] The CRGPA minimum average is 2.67 and the CGPA minimum average is 2.40 - the competitive averages will never be below
                                                       these minima.

                                                       [ 48 ] Continuation Requirements
                                                       [ 49 ] Students who do not maintain at least a 2.40 CGPA will be placed on probation within the School. Courses available to
                                                       probationary students may be limited. Each term, these students must [ @ 51 ] consult an advisor [ 50 ] prior to enrollment and must
                                                       achieve either a term 2.40 term GPA or an improved CGPA. Students who fail to do so may be removed from the program.
                                                       [ 52 ] Reinstatement from probationary standing occurs when the CGPA improves to 2.40 or better and is maintained.

                                                       [ 53 ] Graduation Requirements
                                                       [ 54 ] A GPA of 2.00 must be obtained for upper division courses used to fulfil the program requirements.

                                                       [ 55 ] Prerequisite Grade Requirement
                                                       [ 56 ] Computing science course entry requires a grade of C- or better in each prerequisite course.
                                                       [ 57 ] A minimum 2.40 CGPA is required for 200, 300 and 400 division CMPT courses. For complete information, contact an
